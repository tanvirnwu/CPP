# **C++ Source Code Analyzer**
This repository hosts a collection of C++ programs designed to analyze and manipulate C++ source code files. From extracting keywords and variables to identifying symbols and filtering comments, these utilities serve as a foundation for building more complex source code analysis tools.


## **Overview**
Each program in this collection serves a unique purpose, providing insights into the structure and components of C++ source files. Here's what each program does:

**1. Keywords and Variables Extractor:** Scans C++ source files to extract and list all keywords and variables, particularly focusing on data types like int, float, double, long, and short.

**2. Symbol Identifier:** Identifies and counts various symbols (#, ., ;, etc.) within C++ source files, providing a summary of the symbols used.

**3. Comment Filter:** Filters out single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments from C++ source files, creating a clean version of the source code without comments.

**4. Preprocessor Directive and Bracket Notation Analyzer:** Analyzes C++ source files to copy lines that start with a preprocessor directive # and end with a closing bracket > directly to the output file, showcasing the ability to identify specific patterns within the source code.
